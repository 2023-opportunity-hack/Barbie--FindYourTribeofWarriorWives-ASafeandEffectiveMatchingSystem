Warrior Wives
Provide a way for women, either former or current service members or wives of service members to be able to find a group of Warrior Wives with similar interests, either locally or online, through a safe and effective automated vetting process.

Skills: vetting an identity, geographical search, matching based on interest, full stack or mobile app
Problem
Military wives lack a secure and customized platform to connect with each other online. They have used Facebook Groups in the past, but they found it unsafe and unsatisfactory. They want to use the I.D.me (or similar) verification process to ensure the identity and safety of the users. 

They also want to have various options to filter and form groups based on their preferences and needs. They have not tried any other platforms for this purpose, because they do not have the expertise to know which ones are truly safe and suitable. They also need help with building their website to host training and resource materials for the military wives. They have a Wix site, but they find it difficult to manage and update. Warrior Wives has considered some other options, but they are not sure how to use them effectively. After running a small nonprofit for 15 years, something you build can help them expand their services and reach more military wives.

Challenges we ran into:
One of the biggest struggles for us was storing user information and their interests in database. Additionally, we have spent great deal of time trying to implement API of ChatGpt in the program. We also had some problems while integrating front-end and back-end parts of our application since some files were removed and others were not simply working. Eventually, of course, we were able to pass through all these challenges by combining our thought processes.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Although we have been betrayed by our teammates 2 times, having 3 members in total, we are proud to announce that we were able to collaborate together and combine JS React, data of Firebase, app since it was our first day learning JS, React, Firebase, and others. We were able to implement our desired features such as Ai ChatBot, search engine, hosting events,gps, maps and many more!There were lots of struggles with visual design.

What we have learned:
We learned quite  a lot during these 2 days ,specifically how to manage user data in Firebase, use API of ChatBot, implement GPS feature in application. Throughout this journey, we have discovered many libraries both for front-end and back-end ,yet many of them were discarded by us. We came to conclusion to learn React JS, which we have heard before but never used it. By having React JS, we were able to create global social app for Warrior wives and product both online/offline events. We are glad to obtain such experience.

The future of the app:
We have already thought of some updates that could significantly improve visual appeal, optimizatation, and range of its abilities( for example, creating communities together, dark theme, real time chatting, premium perks, more custom features for individual profile, status of friends and many more).
